This bug occurs when using the Expo `useLocalAuthentication` hook in combination with a custom authentication flow.  The issue arises when the authentication prompt fails or is canceled by the user. The hook doesn't consistently reset its state, leading to subsequent authentication attempts failing silently.  The `status` remains stuck in a previous state (e.g., `'pending'`), preventing the app from entering the correct authentication flow or displaying appropriate error messages.
